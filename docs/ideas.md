### Inovative Idea 
Group Upsilon will be creating a recipe recommender called `APPetizer`. Users can input variables, such as ingredients they want to use or types of food theyâ€™d like to make, and receive recipe suggestions. This application will differ from existing recipe catalog web applications because it allows users to find recipes based on specific ingredients - a useful tool for those trying to use up ingredients in their fridge or pantry, or even just for homecooks who are trying to be a little more creative. 

### Important Components
1. Search
	- Provide the ability to search for recipes, based on various inputs. At minimum, this will include ingredient-based search. Other search criterion we'd like to implement include cuisine type, dietary restriction categories, etc.
2. Account Creation
	- With personal accounts, users will be able to save favorite recipes. They can also maintain a grocery list based on recipes they've saved. Given time, we would also like to create functionality for users to comment, like, or share recipes.
3. Recipe Upload
	- Users can also upload their own recipes, which will be stored in our database
4. Pantry Log
	- We will implement this component only if we first implement the others well and have time remaining. It gives users the ability to keep a log of food items they already have at home, which can assist the user by providing an inventory. More importantly, however, it will assist the search functionality of our application, allowing it to suggest recipes to users for which the required ingredient list most closely matches the items they have at home.
