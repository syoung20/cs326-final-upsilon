### Inovative Idea 
Group Upsilon will be creating a recipe recommender called `APPetizer`. Users can input ingredient in their pantry they would like to use up or types of food theyâ€™d like to make, and then find recipe suggestions. Users can also add their own recipes to the website. Hopefully this would be useful for using extra food and pantry items wisely during self-quarantine. 

### Important Components
1. Search
	- Provide the ability to search for recipes
2. Account Creation
	- With personal accounts, users will be able to save favorite recipes
