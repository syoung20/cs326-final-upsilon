#Wireframes

##Wireframe for a recipe page
![Recipe Wireframe](/wireframes/recipe.png)

##Wireframes for account page
![Account Recipe Book Wireframe](/wireframes/recipe_book.png)
![Account Pantry Wireframe](/wireframes/pantry.png)
The grocery list tab on the account page will be the same as the pantry tab, with only the data differing.

#Mockups

##Mockups for recipe page
Below are the recipe header and recipe details. The contents of the second picture, ingredients and instructions, are directly underneath the contents of the first. Below all of these are the tags and comment sections.

##Mockups for account page
These are both the recipe-book and pantry tabs of the account page. It is a one page HTML document, but the display will change in order to show contents of different tabs. The grocery list will look like the pantry tab.
