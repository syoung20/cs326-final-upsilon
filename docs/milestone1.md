## Mockups for recipe page
Below are the recipe header and recipe details. The contents of the second picture, ingredients and instructions, are directly underneath the contents of the first. Below all of these are the tags and comment sections.

## Mockups for account page
These are both the recipe-book and pantry tabs of the account page. It is a one page HTML document, but the display will change in order to show contents of different tabs. The grocery list will look like the pantry tab.

# Divison of Labor
We divided labor by pages. Sarah worked on the recipe and account pages (recipe.html, recipe.css, account.html, account.css). Tinsae worked on the home page and recipe creation pages (index.html, style.css, create.html). Nick worked on the login, signup and result pages (login.html, signup.html, login.css, results.html, results.css).
